In this problem, you are tasked with handling a series of operations on an array of integers using pointers and references. The operations you need to perform are updating the value of an element and calculating the sum of elements within a specified range. It is crucial that you access and modify the array elements strictly through pointers and references, avoiding direct array indexing.

Input
You are given input that consists of 3 or more lines:

An integer n
 (number of integers), followed by integer m
 (number of operations).
The next line contains a sequence of n
 integers a1,a2,…,an
.
The operations (op i j)
, where the number of operations is in the range [1;50]
, are described as follows:
set i j
: Set the value of the i
-th element to j
, where i
 is a 0-based index and j
 is an integer.
sum i j
: Find the sum of elements from index i
 to index j
 inclusively, where i
 and j
 are 0-based indices.
You must use pointers and references to access and modify the array elements. Standard input and output have to be used. You are guaranteed to have described valid input format.

Constraints:

Array size: [1, 25]; Array elements: [-50, 49]
Number of operations: 1≤m≤50
Output
The number of output lines will be less than or equal to the number of operations applied. Each line should represent the outcome for the sum
 operation:

The last line should contain all the modified array elements.

Note
Use pointers and references for array element access and modification to comply with the problem requirements. Directly indexing the array is not allowed.
